On the forums people often ask these questions about pocket operators. We're here to give you answers!

## Which pocket operator to start with?

A commonly asked question on the pocket operator forums, especially from beginners, is "which pocket operator should I get first?" and "which pocket operator should I buy for my boy/girlfriend?"

Whether you're buying for yourself or a loved one, deciding on your first pocket operator can be tough. The consensus on the forums seems to be that the best pocket operator beginners and experienced musicians alike is the [PO-33 Knockout!](https://teenage.engineering/store/po-33). This is because it is a fully fledged sampler that fits in your pocket, so you can sample any source at all and them make music using that sound. This gives it incredible flexibility.

If the person you are buying for is into synths they they will probably like the [PO-32 Tonic](https://teenage.engineering/store/po-32/) which lets you build your own synth patches using the Microtonic software.

If the person you are buying for is into chiptune or retro games then they will probably like the [PO-20 Arcade](https://teenage.engineering/store/po-20) because it's specifically geared towards making sounds like old school game consoles.

The next most recommended pocket operators include the [PO-24 office](https://teenage.engineering/store/po-24/), [PO-28 robot](https://teenage.engineering/store/po-28/), and the [PO-16 factory](https://teenage.engineering/store/po-16/) which each have their own specialty sounds.

## How do I sync my pocket operator?

You can sync your pocket operator with other pocket operators, and with a variety of other devices such as Korg's Volca devices. [Some music making apps also sync with pocket operators](/pocket-operator-apps.html). The way this works is by plugging a cable with 3.5mm stereo jacks between the devices and then putting the pocket operator into sync mode. You can [buy compatible sync cables from Teenage Engineering](https://teenage.engineering/store/audio-cable-kit-150mm-x3/) but any 3.5mm stereo to stereo cable will work and you can get them everywhere.

There is a [good instructional on the TE site on how to sync between pocket operators](https://support.teenage.engineering/hc/en-us/articles/360001346214-how-do-i-synchronize-my-pocket-operator-). If you're syncing from an app on your phone you simply plug the cable from the heaphone jack into the left side of the pocket operator and put the pocket operator in SY4 or SY5 mode.
