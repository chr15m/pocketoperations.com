### Stands to prop up your pocket operator device

A stand is a good way to set your pocket operator up more permanently in place. For example if you're using your pocket operator for studio recording or if you are playing a live show and you don't want the device sliding around. Let's face it the little metal stands are great but quit flimsy. A stand can give you a more solid backing.
